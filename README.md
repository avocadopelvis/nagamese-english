# Master Thesis
## Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation for Nagamese to English. 
Nagamese is an Assamese-lexified creole language spoken natively in the Northeastern Indian state of Nagaland and it functions as the lingua franca of the state. It is considered a low-resource language i.e. a language that has limited availability of linguistic resources, such as written text, audio recordings, and computational tools, as well as a lack of research and development efforts compared to more widely spoken languages.

## Tasks
- [x] Scrape English & Nagamese text from the Bible website.
- [ ] Scrape Nagamese text from Nagamese Khobor. (ongoing)
- [x] Create a parallel corpus for Nagamese-English.
- [x] Train baseline models for Nagamese-English & English-Nagamese.
- [ ] Fine-tune mBART-50 on the dataset.
